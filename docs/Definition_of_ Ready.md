# Definition of Ready

💡 The Definition of Ready is the agreement that the Product Owner has with the Dev Team on what each user story **needs to have to be a candidate to be executed or developed** (next or further sprint)

### Purpose
---
The purpose of the DoR is to mitigate REWORK!!!


### For each individual sprint
---
What we need for each sprint.

- [ ]  **Has the story the INVEST criteria** 
- “I” ndependent (of all others as practicable) 
- “N” egotiable (not a specific contract for features) 
- “V” aluable (or vertical) 
- “E” stimable (to a good approximation) 
- “S” mall (so as to fit within an iteration) 
- “T” estable (in principle, even if there isn’t a test for it yet) 
- [ ]  **It has Acceptance Criteria.**
- [ ]  **It has a Prototype (low or high fidelity) (optional).**
- [ ]  **It has the Stakeholders’ agreement.**
- [ ]  **The Acceptance Criteria was evaluated by the Dev Team (Feasible or not, or there is a better way to do this).**
- [ ]  **Another person can execute it without further questions (clarity).**

- A user story is clear if all Scrum team members have a shared understanding of what it means. Collaboratively writing user stories, and adding acceptance criteria to the high-priority ones facilitates clarity.  
- An item is testable if there is an effective way to determine if the functionality works as expected. Acceptance criteria ensure that each story can be tested.  
- A user story is feasible if it can be completed in one sprint, according to the Definition of Done. If this is not achievable, it needs to be broken down further.
